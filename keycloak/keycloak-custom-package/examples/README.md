Keycloak Examples
=================

This directory contains a number of examples for Keycloak.

Demo
----

This is the our main example, which shows Login, Single-Sign On, Single-Sign Out and OAuth Token Grant. The demo comes in two flavours: 

* Preconfigured - Use this flavour to quickly deploy the demo to a local Keycloak server without having to configure anything other than importing the realm settings into Keycloak
* Unconfigured - Use this flavour to manually configure and deploy the demo to either a local or external Keycloak server

For more information look at `preconfigured-demo/README.md` or `unconfigured-demo/README.md`. For the unconfigured-demo there's an accompanying screencast at [http://keycloak.org/docs](http://keycloak.org/docs) that walks you through the setup process.
