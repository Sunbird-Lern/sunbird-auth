Hacking on Keycloak
===================

GitHub Repository
-----------------

### Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one

[Join GitHub](https://github.com/join)

### Fork Keycloak repository into your account

[https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak)

### Clone your newly forked copy onto your local workspace

    git clone https://github.com/<your username>/keycloak.git
    cd keycloak
    
### Add a remote ref to upstream for pulling future updates
    
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak.git
    
### Pull later updates from upstream

    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/master
    
    
Discuss changes
---------------

Before starting work on a new feature or anything besides a minor bug fix join the [Keycloak Dev mailing list](https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/keycloak-dev) 
and send a mail about your proposed changes. This is vital as otherwise you may waste days implementing a feature that is later rejected.

Once you have received feedback from the mailing list if there's not one already create a (JIRA issue)[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK].
 

Implement changes
-----------------

We don't currently enforce a code style in Keycloak, but a good reference is the code style used by WildFly. This can be retrieved from [Wildfly ide-configs](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/tree/master/ide-configs).To import formatting rules, see following [instructions](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ImportFormattingRules)

If your changes requires updates to the database read [Updating Database Schema](UpdatingDatabaseSchema.md).

To try your changes out manually you can quickly start Keycloak from within your IDEA or Maven, to find out how to do this
read [Testsuite](Testsuite.md). It's also important that you add tests to the testsuite for your changes.  
 

Get your changes merged into upstream
-------------------------------------

Here's a quick check list for a good pull request (PR):

* Discussed and agreed on Keycloak Dev mailing list
* One commit per PR
* One feature/change per PR
* No changes to code not directly related to your change (e.g. no formatting changes or refactoring to existing code, if you want to refactor/improve existing code that's a separate discussion to mailing list and JIRA issue)
* A JIRA associated with your PR (include the JIRA issue number in commit comment)
* All tests in testsuite pass
* Do a rebase on upstream master
* We only accept contributions to the master branch. The exception to this is if the fix is for the latest CR release and Final has not yet been released, in which case you can send the PR to both the corresponding branch and the master branch.

Once you're happy with your changes go to GitHub and create a PR to the master branch.
